advanced virtual farmer (discord bot) autofarm

# ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS!!!


Required software for setup:

1. https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki download the latest version

2. https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpos/ (not required, but heavily recommended)

3. An autoclicker. I recommend this one https://www.opautoclicker.com/ however I cannot guarantee anything about its safety.

4. Recent version of Python (I used 3.9)

Unless you have a 2560x1440 monitor, you **will** have to change the code depending on your monitor resolution
